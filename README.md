# VUT-IDS-project (2022/2023)

Goal of this project was to learn how to create a database with `Oracle SQL`. Creating tables, SELECT commands, Procedures, Triggers, etc.

Task of this team was to create a database for a shop, so we naturally decided to exclusively sell only liquors and fruit (from which you can make liquor).
How the database should look was not really in the assignment, so we had to imagine and create it ourselves

## Subtasks

The whole project was divided into 4 subtasks:

1. Create an *ER diagram* for your decided theme in `UML` and also *Use Case diagram*. (max 5 points)
2. Connect to the school server, create the database from previous task in `SQL` and fill it up with your chosen information. (max 5 points)
3. Create at least 7 `SELECT` commands that will use your data and also use various closures like `GROUP BY`, predicates like `EXISTS` or `IN` and comment, what your SELECTS do. (max 5 points)
4. Create complex `SQL` script that will use *indexes*, `EXPLAIN PLAN`, SELECTS with `WITH` and `CASE` operators, also create `MATERIALIZED VIEW` for your colleague, etc. (max 19 points)

## How to use

If you would like to run this project, make sure you use `ORACLE SQL`, otherwise the project will not work. If you use correct database, then the **main script** (`xlukas15_xmorku03.sql`) should run instantly without any issues. If not, then check if you don't already have the same tables in your database.

The file `data.sql` was used to create various demo data, that were later added into the **main script**, so it does not need to be used.

Note that all the comments are written in Czech language only.
